# Some random simple Weather app
This is just a simple weather app without any styling at all.

## Requirements
Node > 16 (this is a must to run unit test)

## Install
`npm ci`

## Some scripts
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Notes
- The coverage is not 100%, and not all components are tested. This can be done easily.
- No styling so it looks a bit ugly unfortunately.
- API KEY should be get from environment variable, but I keep it here for simplicity. It is public key anyway.
- I did not use TypeScript as it makes things more complicated. TS can be brought into this without problem.
